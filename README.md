# Medium::API

Interface to the posting API of the medium.com blogging platform
(see https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs)

## Synopsis

## Description

This provides an interface to post content to the medium.com blogging

Currently it uses "Self-issued access tokens" rather than the full OAuth2
negotiation as this should be simpler for the envisaged applications.
